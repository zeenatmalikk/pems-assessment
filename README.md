# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹
## PEMS Digital Frontend Dev Hiring Assignment
This is a React Native mobile app built using Expo for the PEMS Digital Frontend Developer hiring assignment. The app fetches and displays users and their corresponding posts using the JSONPlaceholder API.

## Features
Home Screen: Displays a list of users fetched from the API, showing 5 users initially and loading more on scroll.
User Posts Screen: Displays posts for the selected user, with infinite scroll (5 posts at a time).
Error Handling: Graceful handling of API errors, including a message for server errors (e.g., 500 errors).
Loading States: Displays loading indicators while data is being fetched from the API.
Navigation: Click on any user to navigate to the userâ€™s posts screen, where you can see the selected user's information and their posts.

## Technologies Used
React Native: For building the mobile app.
Expo: To simplify development, testing, and deployment.
Axios/Fetch API: For fetching data from the JSONPlaceholder API.
Hooks: Utilized useState and useEffect for managing state and handling side effects.
Infinite Scroll: Implemented infinite scrolling using a flat list for smooth data loading.

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
